# Simple-Language-Interpreter

A basic code using python
Importing GoogleTrans to translate the sentence into user definer language.
Like here,

The sentence in English is....
'I AM ARNAB SARKAR'

Now the defined language is 'hi' means Hindi.

So after interpreting the new sentence in Hindi will be,
' मैं अर्नब सरकार हूं '.

This is how the code works.
